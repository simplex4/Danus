"""Role -> allowed-tools table — the permission skeleton of the whole system.

This is the single, first-class source of truth for separation of duties: which
MCP tools each agent role may even see. It is data (easy to audit / change), not
logic scattered across the server.

Invariants (load-bearing — see ARCHITECTURE.md §3):
  - ``main`` has NO ``fact_submit``: the main agent cannot bypass verification. Experimental
    ``candidate_submit`` relays a frozen proof package to the same verifier.
  - ``verifier`` is read-only: only ``search_arxiv_theorems`` (it reads the fact
    graph as files, writes nothing).
  - ``worker`` is the only role that can ``fact_submit`` (verifier-gated write).
All three roles get ``search_arxiv_theorems`` (literature grounding); ``worker``
and ``main`` additionally get ``fact_search`` (read view over verified facts).
